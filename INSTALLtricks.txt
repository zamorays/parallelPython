This is a try to get the principal tricks to install a parallel enviroment for examples showing here!
At least this works for UBUNTU 12.04 (i belive that for almost all linux distributions with pertinent considerations).

FIRTS: In many cases for get the latest distributions of python libraries, cuda libraries, opencl extensions, etc.
    its a good idea to use git distribution for manage all this packages.

    If you dont have git installed, type:

	USER$ sudo apt-get install git

    courisly, for get the latest git, you have to use git!. To get some repos to build in your PC only type:

	USER$ git clone http://git_disttribution_of_you_want

    Almost everything in git online repos has a good INSTALL documentation, the best part is that 
    generally include many examples.

SECOND: PYTHON ENVIROMENT. (I use Python 2.7.3)
    
    BASIC PYTHON LIBRARIES (easy way! & has update versions) (I dont remember thas was a lot!!!) (Be patient!)

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip
    $ sudo pip install pip -U         (for upgrade, reset the terminat to reload bash)
    $ sudo pip install Sphinx         (Documentation)
    $ sudo pip install nose           (Test packages and builds, also our work)
    $ sudo apt-get install g++ gfortran
    $ sudo pip install pyparsing Pillow
    $ sudo apt-get install python-tk pyqtgraph (the last install scipy & numpy)
    $ sudo apt-get install python-wxtools python-gtk2-dev python-cxx
    
    NOT So Importants but interensting
    $ sudo apt-get install python-visual
    (Build Mayavi: http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/installation.html)
    
    IMPORTANTS
    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev (To install developer version)
    (bulid cython from: https://github.com/cython/cython or type: sudo pip install cython)
    $ sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev (Think is note necessary, but there are some other libraries that i think need it)
    $ sudo pip install numpy scipy matplotlib sympy  (I think that this dont require a special build on the system)
    
   
    
    
    IPYTHON: This is a new an exciting way to share with others the work done!
    
    Stable versionat day 1.1.0:
    git repo at: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/rel-1.1.0

    Develop version 2.0: (Has some changes, in interfaz a lot!. I used and for me is stable):
    git repo at: https://github.com/ipython/ipython

    Bulding...
    
    Requiriments:
	USER/dir/to/ipython/repo$ python setup.py
	
	For me says:
	BUILDING IPYTHON
              python: 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06)  [GCC 4.6.3]
